            <h2>Two days before the competition</h2> 
            <p> Dakar Wangchuk sat in the dim light of her bedroom, fingers flying across the keyboard. The rhythmic click-clack of the keys was the only sound breaking the silence. It was 2:37 AM, and the competition was only two days away.

She looked at the clock, her eyes bleary from lack of sleep. Across the room, her twin brother, Jigme Wangchuk, sat on his bed, casually browsing through his phone, his coding assignment long completed.

"Don't you think you should get some rest?" he asked, glancing up. His voice was always calm, like he never had a care in the world.

"I can’t," Dakar replied without looking at him. "Not when I’m this close."

Jigme, who had already finished the final project for the coding competition with ease, knew she was pushing herself to her limits. But he said nothing more. He could sense how much this meant to her. The weight of comparison had always hung between them, a silent presence in their home. He was always the golden child. Always the one who effortlessly excelled. And Dakar, always in his shadow, always working harder just to stay afloat.

“I know you’ll do great,” Jigme said quietly. “I believe in you.”

She nodded, though the words didn’t quite reach her. She wanted to believe it, but everything about the competition felt like one more moment in which she’d be compared to him. The judges wouldn’t see her work as anything more than the "lesser twin’s effort."

            <h2>Competition</h2> 
            <p> The auditorium was filled with the quiet hum of keyboards and the soft clink of coffee cups. Rows of computers sat in front of hundreds of competitors, but Dakar could only focus on the screen in front of her. The problem set was difficult, but nothing she couldn’t handle. Or so she thought.

Her mind raced through the code she had written. She had thought her solution was solid, but as she tested the program for the final time, an error popped up. Then another. She grimaced, running the test cases again. Nothing worked.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Jigme’s screen—perfectly running, the solution so clean it almost looked like it had been written by a machine.

"Do you need help?" he asked, his voice soft but clear, even from across the room.

Dakar shook her head fiercely. "I can do this on my own."

But deep down, a seed of doubt had been planted. Could she? Could she really pull this off without his natural genius?

            <h2>⛰️ Dharamsala</h2> 
            <p> The time was up. A countdown timer blinked red, signaling the end of the competition. Dakar stared at her incomplete code, the errors glaring at her like failures. She submitted her project anyway, but she knew it wasn’t perfect.

As the judges made their rounds, inspecting the submissions, Dakar’s heart pounded in her chest. She tried not to look over at Jigme, who was calmly interacting with the judges, answering their questions with ease. He was a picture of confidence, while she was a storm of anxiety, second-guessing every line of code.

Finally, the moment came. The judge, a middle-aged woman with short-cropped hair and a warm smile, stood before her.

“Dakar Wangchuk,” the judge said, adjusting her glasses, “Your submission is… interesting.”

Dakar’s stomach flipped.

“We found that your solution, while incomplete, showed exceptional potential. You’ve implemented several creative methods to address the problem. It’s clear you were thinking outside the box.”

Dakar blinked, not sure if she had heard that correctly.

The judge continued, “You may not have solved everything, but you did something I haven’t seen in any of the other submissions. You thought for yourself.”

Her heart swelled in her chest. It wasn’t the victory she had imagined, but it felt like something deeper—a validation that didn’t come from winning.

The judge smiled. “I think you have a future in this. Don’t sell yourself short.”  The results were read aloud in front of the entire room.

"And the winner of the competition," the host announced, "is Jigme Wangchuk."

A round of applause erupted. Jigme stood up, humble as always, and walked to the stage. He didn’t gloat, didn’t bask in the glory. He just shook the hands of the judges, accepting his win quietly.

But as he turned to leave the stage, he caught sight of Dakar in the crowd. She hadn’t stood, hadn’t cheered. She was sitting there, looking at her hands, unsure of what to feel.

After the event, while the crowd was dispersing, Jigme approached her.

“You did well,” he said, as if it were the simplest thing to say. “Really.”

Dakar looked at him, her face pale. “But I didn’t win. I’m not even sure I deserve to be here.”

He sat beside her, a gentle understanding in his eyes. “You do deserve to be here. You’ve always been good enough. You just… haven’t seen it yet.”

She turned to him, her voice cracking. “I tried so hard, Jigme. But I’m always in your shadow. I feel like I’ll never be good enough—no matter how hard I work.”

Jigme reached out, placing a hand on her shoulder. “You don’t need to be me, Dakar. You never have. You’re already more than enough.”

Her eyes welled with tears. “But I’m never going to win. I’ll always be the second one.”

“You’re wrong,” he said, his voice firm. “You’re never second. You just have your own path. And that’s more than enough.”

        <h2></h2>
        <p> From the sacred heights of Yumbhulhagang in the Yarlung Valley to the grandeur of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet’s historical journey reflects a profound evolution — from mythic beginnings to a unified kingdom grounded in spiritual leadership and cultural identity. The 7th-century move to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo marked a turning point in Tibet’s political and religious life, with the Potala becoming a lasting symbol of that union. Today, as the map traces these historic paths, it also points beyond — to Dharamsala in exile, where the spirit of Tibet continues to thrive through memory, resistance, and renewal. </p>
