            <h2>Two days before the competition</h2> 
            <p> Dakar Wangchuk sat in her bedroom, fingers across the keyboard. The click-clack of the keys was the only sound breaking the silence. It was 2:35 AM, and the competition was only two days away.

She looked at the clock, her eyes very heavy from lack of sleep. Across the room, her twin brother, Jigme Wangchuk, sat on his bed, casually browsing through his phone, his coding assignment long completed.

"Don't you think you should get some rest?" he asked.

"I can’t," Dakar replied without looking at him. "Im so close."

Jigme, who had already finished the final project for the coding competition, knew she was pushing herself to her limits. But he said nothing. He could sense how much this meant to her. The weight of comparison had always stayed between them. He was always the golden child. Always the one who excelled. And Dakar was always working harder but never noticed.

“I know you’ll do great,” Jigme said quietly. “I believe in you.”

She nodded, though the words didn’t quite reach her. She wanted to believe it.

            <h2>Competition</h2> 
            <p> The auditorium was filled with the clack of keyboards and the clinks of coffee cups. Rows of computers sat in front of hundreds of competitors, but Dakar could only focus on the screen in front of her. The problem set was difficult, but nothing she couldn’t handle. Or she thought.

Her mind flew through the code she had written. She had thought her solution was good, but as she tested the program for the final time, an error popped up. Then another. She was in shock, running the test cases again. Nothing worked.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Jigme’s screen—perfectly running, the solution so clean it almost looked like it had been written by a machine.

"Do you need help?" he asked, his voice soft but clear, even from across the room.

Dakar shook her head fiercely. "I can do this on my own."

But deep down, she was in dout. Could she?

            <h2>⛰️ Dharamsala</h2> 
            <p> The time was up. A countdown timer blinked red with a long buzz, signaling the end of the competition. Dakar stared at her incomplete code, the errors glaring at her like failures. She submitted her project anyway, but she knew it wasn’t perfect.

As the judges made their rounds, looking at the submissions, Dakar’s heart pounded in her chest. She tried not to look over at Jigme, who was calmly sitting with the judges, answering their questions.

Finally, the moment came. The judge, a woman with short hair and a black suit, stood before her.

“Dakar Wangchuk,” the judge said, adjusting her glasses, “Your submission is… interesting.”

Dakar’s stomach flipped.

“We found that your solution, incomplete, showed amazing effort. You’ve shown several creative methods to fix the problem. It’s clear you were trying your hardest.”

Dakar blinked, not sure if she had heard that correctly.

The judge continued, “You may not have solved everything, but you did something I haven’t seen in any of the other competitions. You worked really hard.”

Her heart swelled in her chest. It wasn’t the victory she had expected, but it felt like something else.

The judge smiled. “I think you have a future in this. Don’t stop working hard.”  The results were read aloud in front of the entire room.

"And the winner of the competition," the host announced, "is Jigme Wangchuk."

A round of applause erupted. Jigme stood up and walked to the stage.He shook the hands of the judges with a smile.

But as he turned to leave the stage, he caught sight of Dakar in the crowd.

After the event, while the crowd was dispersing, Jigme approached her.

“You did well,” he said, “Really.”

Dakar looked at him, her face pale. “But I didn’t win,”

He sat beside her, a gentle understanding in his eyes. “You’ve always been good enough. You just…havent been noticed yet.”
              
She turned to him, her voice cracking. “I feel like I’ll never be good enough,no matter how hard I work.”

“You'll win someday,”

Her eyes welled with tears. “I’m never going to win. I’ll always be the second one.”

“You’re wrong,” he said, “You’re never second. You just have your own ways. And that’s more than enough,”

        <h2></h2>
        <p> From the sacred heights of Yumbhulhagang in the Yarlung Valley to the grandeur of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet’s historical journey reflects a profound evolution — from mythic beginnings to a unified kingdom grounded in spiritual leadership and cultural identity. The 7th-century move to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo marked a turning point in Tibet’s political and religious life, with the Potala becoming a lasting symbol of that union. Today, as the map traces these historic paths, it also points beyond — to Dharamsala in exile, where the spirit of Tibet continues to thrive through memory, resistance, and renewal. </p>
